# Innovators's Catechism
The Innovator's Catechism is an operations order for use by innovation teams proposed in the paper "The Innovator's Catechism". It is built from the [Facilitator's Catechism](https://github.com/COGSEC/FacilitatorsCatechism) with consideration for requirements by market-facing teams following the "Innovation Pipeline" [defined by Steve Blank](https://steveblank.com/2017/09/14/how-companies-strangle-innovation/).
